# iOSTest-MVVM
A 100% code network request app

## About
This app is the result of my studies using MVVM, JSON, Coordinators pattern and Codable protocol. It is a simple app without using storyboards, it consists of a JSON with some information fetched by a network request, I have used the codable protocol to do the JSON handling. The app has some Coordinators pattern code example as well.

## Features
* List of all available courses
* Click in an item of the list shows his details(TODO)
* Use Coordinators pattern to simplify the navigation and view controllers(TODO)
